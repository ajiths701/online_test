The online_test public Git repository contains two branches; which are test1 and test2.

Test1
------

This script is to display an alphanumeric series called FizzBuzz for a given range of positive integers. 

The Format is as below;


   Display as "Fizz" if integer is a multiple of 3
   Display as "Buzz" if integer is a multiple of 5
   Display as "FizzBuzz" if integer is a multiple of 3 & 5	
   If not meeting above conditions; display the integer as it is.
  
   E.g. for f[12,16], the output is "Fizz 13 14 FizzBuzz 16".


Test2
------

This script is to display an alphanumeric series called FizzBuzzBazz for a given range of positive integers. 

The Format is as below;


   Display as "Fizz" if integer is a multiple of 3
   Display as "Buzz" if integer is a multiple of 5
   Display as "FizzBuzz" if integer is a multiple of 3 & 5
   Display as "Bazz" instead of an integer after consecutive Fizzes/Buzzes.
   If not meeting above conditions; display the integer as it is.
  
  
  E.g. for f[4,16], the output is “4 Buzz Fizz Bazz 8 Fizz Buzz Bazz Fizz 13 14 FizzBuzz 16”.
